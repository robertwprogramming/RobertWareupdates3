# Biased. 

Everyone has biases...

And retaining any of the number of individual biases does not make someone a bad person at all. In fact, it is a reflection of human nature and every perceived bias isn't always negative. With "Biased", I sought out in 2018 to become more knowledgeable of the various forms of cognitive bias. Those that seeped into the social landscape and those that dominated the political realm. I also took this time to internally reflect upon my own biases. This did wonders for myself socially, personally, professionally, etc. So, I became motivated to create an application centered around my findings and the ability to simply allow users to become aware of their own perceived biases in a non-judgemental way. The portions below are very limited screenshots of one small module of the entire app. Its more or less a choose your own adventure style for the user to consider a number of scenarios and how they would respond to them. There are pre-determined results based on text-book examples of a cognitive bias and the user would be presented with those results. I would rather have waited until I iron out the UI side of things before showcasing them. But, I think this will provide a good opportunity for outside assistance as I am trying to find the best way to take so much information and present it in an interactive style. I also plan to include news clips and garner the reaction of the user based on what they think. A percentage or chart element will be factored in to keep track of where one lines amongst an exhaustive list of biases. Trivia, games, etc. Thank you.
